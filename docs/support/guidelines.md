Here at BlackTeam Corporation we are striving to create a non-toxic and friendly environement for everyone to enjoy. 

We developed Block Fortress in order for old players of the BLOCKADE 3D era to reunite with their friends aswell for new players to enjoy what once were considered simplier times.  

The following guidelines have been created in order to ensure that our goals are met and understood by everyone. If you see someone not following them make sure to report it to us via our [Discord server]() or by emailing us at blockfortressfps@gmail.com.

## Common things to follow
1. **You must at least be 13 years old in order to play Block Fortress.** We are enforcing the [Children's Online Privacy Protection Act](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule).
2. **Be respectful towards players and staff members.** Participating or encouraging harassment won't be tolerated, contact a staff member immediately if you are victim of harassement.
3. **Do not organize or promote hate speech.** Organizing or promoting hate speech for the sole purpose of attacking a person on attributes based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, gender, sexual orientation, religious affiliation or disabilities is unacceptable.
4. **Do not threaten of violence another player.** This includes indirect threats were telling us that "I was just joking" will be punishable as well as threatening to share a player's private personal information (doxxing) such as their name, address, picture, password or others.
5. **Do not spam the in-game chats.** They are meant to be an useful communication method, to ask for help or/and make new friends.
6. **Do not send viruses or malware.** Attempting to DDoS or phish attack another player by sending links to maliscious sites is not permitted. 
7. **Do not spam a developer if you encounter a bug.** We have dedicated channels on our Discord server meant to report bugs or/and players, use them.
8. **Do not beg a developer to become staff.** We only recruit new staff members via an official form, announcements are made when we are looking for new trainees and by begging us, your chance of being accepted becomes low.
9. **Do not beg a staff member to give you access to unfair items or powers.** Begging for things such as more health, changing your player size, changing your in-game nickname or anything of the sorts will result in a server kick.
1. **Do not advertise other games.** We ask that you don't advertise other games when using in-game chats. You can talk about other games but sponsoring it is not allowed.

## What to not do with your account

!!! danger "You bear full responsability of your account!"
	You will be punished even if an act was commited on your account by someone else. ^^**Remember to not share your account password with someone else.**^^
1. **Do not promote and/or use any kinds of cheating software.** This is obvious to pretty much anyone but play fair and don't cheat, it is also recommended that you don't joke about owning a cheat.
2. **Do not falsly accuse another player.** Wasting the time of a staff member by falsly accusing another player without providing any real proof or reason is unnaceptable *especially* because of rage. 
3. **Do not pretend to be a staff member.** Usurping the identity of an official Block Fortress staff member is not tolerated.
4. **Do not attempt by any means to break the game.** You will be permanently banned if you have attempted to break the game or by DDoSing[^1] our servers for the sole purpose of killing the enjoyments for other players.
