Here at BlackTeam Corporation we are striving to create a non-toxic and friendly environement for everyone to enjoy. 

We developed Block Fortress in order for old players of the BLOCKADE 3D era to reunite with their friends aswell for new players to enjoy what once were considered simplier times.  

The following guidelines have been created in order to ensure that our goals are met and understood by everyone. If you see someone not following them make sure to report it to us via our [Discord server]() or by emailing us at blockfortressfps@gmail.com.

## Common things to follow
1. **You must be 13+ of age in order to play Block Fortress.** We are enforcing the [Children's Online Privacy Protection Act](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule).
2. **Be respectful towards other players including/or any staff members.** Participating or encouraging harassment towards other players won't be tolerated, if you are victim of this contact a staff member immediately.  
3. **Do not organize or promote clans that are based arround hate speech.** Organizing or promoting clans for the sole purpose of attacking a person on attributes based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, gender, sexual orientation, religious affiliation or disabilities is unacceptable.
4. **Do not threaten of violence to another player.** This includes indirect threats were telling us that "I was just joking" will be punishable as well as threatening to share another player's private personal information (doxxing) such as their name, address, picture, password or others.
5. **Do not spam the in-game chats.** It is meant to be an useful communication method or to simply ask for help and make new friends, spamming them with copypastas or meaningless letters is not recommended.
6. **Do not send viruses or malware.** We have no tolerance on shady users trying to phish attack or DDoS other players by sending maliscious links.
7. **Do not spam a developer if you encounter a bug.** Check out the dedicated channel on our Discord server meant to report bugs or/and players.
8. **Do not beg a developer to become admin.** We won't give administrator to players that aren't qualified for the job so don't bother asking, announcements will be made once we are in need and by begging us you are blocking any chance that you have if applying. 
9. **Do not beg a staff member to give you access to unfair items or powers.** Begging for things such as more health, changing your player size, changing your in-game nickname or anything of the sorts will result in a server kick.

1. **Do not promote and/or use any kinds of cheating software.** This is obvious to pretty much anyone but play fair and don't cheat, it is also recommended that you don't joke about owning a cheat.
